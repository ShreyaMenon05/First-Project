The Flight Fare Predictor aims to forecast flight ticket prices based on multiple features like airline, travel class, source, destination, and travel date. By leveraging machine learning models, this project intends to assist travelers in planning their trips efficiently and help airlines optimize pricing strategies.
The source code was developed using Python and managed in Jupyter Notebook.

OBJECTIVES: 
● The project aims to collect and preprocess flight fare data from reliable sources for analysis.
● It will analyze and identify the most significant features influencing flight ticket prices.
● Multiple machine-learning models will be developed and trained to predict flight fares.
● The models will be evaluated and compared based on performance metrics to select the best one.
● A user-friendly interface will be created to display the predicted flight fares for users.
